# Web Scraping

**Background**

Project story:
- Testing out different python modules for scraping data from different websites.

**Scope**

Project plan and tasks:
- Mission to Mars uses python, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/), [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), and [MongoDB Atlas](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/atlas.html) (graded bootcamp assignment).
- scrape_table uses python, pandas, and [Gazpacho](https://pypi.org/project/gazpacho/)

**Analysis**

Project statistics:
- None, yet.

<!-- |Table|Col1|Col2|
|----|----|----|
|1|2|3|4| -->

**Findings**

Project insights from data and process:
- Gazpacho was easier to use on the dropdown list (month and year options) than the table data.
- ```read_html``` was very easy to use to scrape, clean and transform this table data. 

**Conclusion**

Futher action, data exploration and limitations.
- Continue to develop by looping through webpages to scrape all available data.
- Installed and used Atom with Hydrogen to code interactively during this project. It was difficult to troubleshoot kernel problems.
